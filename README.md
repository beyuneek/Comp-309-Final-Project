# Bicycle Theft Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of bicycle thefts and the potential of recovery, leveraging the Toronto Police Department's dataset. We aim to improve community safety by applying logistic regression and decision tree models.

## Data Preparation and Exploration
- **Dataset**: Bicycle theft data from the Toronto Police Department.
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing; Power BI for visualization.

## Model Development and Evaluation
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy assessment through confusion matrices, ROC curves.

## Deployment
- **Application**: Flask-based API for real-time theft prediction.

## Conclusion
Our tool aims to mitigate bicycle thefts, contributing to safer urban communities.
